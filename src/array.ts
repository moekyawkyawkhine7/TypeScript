let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3]; // you can declare like this for array
// so you need to put number data into it.
let numbersOne = []; // it is any array declaration so you can declare like this
numbersOne[0]= 1;
numbersOne[1]= "2"; // you can see it will be againt the benefit of TypeScript type safety
// so you need to ignore it when you developing project by using TypeScript
// Another benefit of TypeScript is type completion. It looks like intellisence. You can't get this feature in Js.
